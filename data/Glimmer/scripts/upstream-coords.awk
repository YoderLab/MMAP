# Usage:  upstream-coords.awk  <len>  <separation>
#   Read gene prediction coordinates from standard input
#   and output the coordinates of the region of length
#    <len>  that is  <sep>  bases before the 5' start
#   of the gene.  Input format is:
#     <tag>  <start>  <stop>
#   Output format is the same.
#   If the length of the gene is longer than  MAX_GENE_LEN ,
#   then the gene is assumed to wrap around a circular genome
#   Note that output coordinates can be negative or longer
#   than the genome length (which is unknown).
